üå± AGRICULTURE PESTICIDE SPRAYING ROBOT USING ARDUINO

This project presents an Arduino-powered robot that automates pesticide spraying in farmlands, designed to move across crops, detect spraying areas, and release pesticides efficiently, thereby reducing manual labor, pesticide wastage, and health risks while ensuring uniform coverage.


Objectives


  - Deliver an effective and uniform pesticide dose in a safe and timely manner.

  - Reduce manual labor and minimize farmer exposure to chemicals.

  - Improve productivity, efficiency, and sustainability in agriculture.

  - Enable smooth navigation on different terrains.

  - Provide mobile-based remote control for easy operation.


‚öôÔ∏è System Design
üîß Hardware Components

  - Arduino Uno (ATmega328P)

  - Motor Driver Modules (L298N)

  - Johnson DC Motors (for movement)

  - Diaphragm Pump Motor (for spraying)

  - Bluetooth Module (HC-05)

  - Pesticide Tank & Sprayer Nozzles

  - Power Supply (Battery)

 - Robot Chassis with Wheels


üíª Software

  - Arduino IDE (programming & control logic)

  - Bluetooth RC Controller Mobile App (to control movement & spraying)


üõ†Ô∏è Working Principle

The Bluetooth module receives commands from a mobile app.

Arduino processes the input and controls DC motors for navigation (forward, backward, left, right).

A relay-controlled diaphragm pump sprays pesticides while the robot moves through the crop field.

The system ensures uniform coverage while keeping farmers away from direct chemical exposure.


‚úÖ Results

Successfully navigates different terrains and soil conditions.

Remote-controlled spraying reduces human health risks.

Easy to operate with minimal training.

Compact, low-cost solution that improves agricultural efficiency.



üîÆ Future Enhancements

Replace Bluetooth with long-range wireless / IoT control.

Integration of AI + Image Processing for crop health monitoring.

Solar-powered charging for longer operation.

GPS-based autonomous navigation.

Use of drone technology for spraying tall crops.


üìå Conclusion

This Arduino-based agriculture robot offers a practical and eco-friendly alternative to manual spraying. It not only reduces health risks but also improves efficiency and crop yield. With further improvements like IoT, AI, and renewable energy integration, such robots can transform modern farming practices.
