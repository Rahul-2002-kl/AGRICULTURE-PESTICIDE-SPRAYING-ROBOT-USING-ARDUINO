# AGRICULTURE-PESTICIDE-SPRAYING-ROBOT-USING-ARDUINO.
This project presents an Arduino-powered robot that automates pesticide spraying in farmlands. It is designed to move across crops, detect the spraying area, and release pesticides efficiently.The robot helps reduce manual labor, pesticide wastage, and health risks for farmers while ensuring uniform coverage.
